> **Note:** Currently, we can set only the `backgroundColor`, `color`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontStyle`, `fontWeight` and `textTransform` CSS properties to the `Label` and `Image` components inside the TabStripItem. More about the usage of those CSS properties can be found in the [Styling]({%slug styling%}#supported-css-properties) article.

> **Note:** On iOS, the TabStripItems can not be stylied individually.
