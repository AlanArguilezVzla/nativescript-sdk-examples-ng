TimePicker can be easily configured by setting the required properties.
The example below demonstrates how to set up the initial `hour` and `minute` for the TimePicker component and how to handle selected time change via `timeChange` event.
The `hour` and `minute` expects integer values and the `timeChange` will return a value of type Date.
